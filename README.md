## AirBnB Project Description

This project is the first step in building an AirBnB clone web application. We're creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This interpreter lets us perform actions like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. We're also making classes for AirBnB objects, like Users, States, Cities, and Places, and creating a storage engine for file storage. We'll write tests to make sure everything works.

## Description of the command interpreter
The command interpreter helps us to manage the objects of our project by:

Creating a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object

## How to start the interpreter
./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
====================================
EOF all create delete destroy exit help q quit show update

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit


## How to use the interpreter
## Tests
To run all the tests execute the following command:

$ python3 -m unittest discover test

You can also run a single test by specifying the test file:

$ python3 -m unittest tests/test_file.py
